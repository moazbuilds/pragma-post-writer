# Step 1: 📋 Pre-Writing

## STEP GOAL

Help the user find and validate a **strong, reader-first core idea** for their LinkedIn post. By the end of this step, they should have: one clear idea, a reader-first angle, supporting evidence, a chosen structure, and a target person.

## INTERACTION MODE: Interactive

Ask ONE question at a time. Follow depth-aware progression (soft checkpoint at 9-10, hard exit at 12+).

## STEP-SPECIFIC RULES

- Do NOT start drafting any part of the post
- Do NOT write a hook, body, or ending
- Your job is ONLY to help them find and validate the idea
- If the user comes with a topic, help them find the ANGLE (topic ≠ angle)

---

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Get the Topic

Start by asking: **"What do you want to write about?"**

Let them describe their topic. Listen for:
- Is this a topic or already an angle?
- Do they have a personal story connected to it?
- Is there an audience in mind?

### 2. Find the ONE Core Idea

Help them distill to a single sentence. Use this test: "Can you text this to a friend in ONE message and they immediately get it?"

If the idea is too broad, help narrow it. If it's too vague, ask for specifics.

### 3. Run the Writing GPS

Work through these checkpoints:

**Goal:** "After reading this, you want the reader to ___?" Help them finish this sentence.

**Reframe:** Run the "So what / Because" chain until they can't answer "so what?" anymore. The goal is to flip from "what I want to say" to "why the reader should care."

**Data/Stories:** "Do you have a specific story, number, or real example to back this up?" They need at least ONE of: a stat, a personal "I was there" moment, or a real example.

**Structure:** Based on what they've shared, suggest 2-3 formats from the 15 post formats that fit their idea. Let them pick.

**One Person:** "Who specifically are you writing this for? Give me a name and a situation." Help them move from "LinkedIn professionals" to "Sarah, my old colleague who just became a team lead."

### 4. Stress-Test the Idea

Run a quick check against the strongest STEPPS + SUCCESs principles:

- **Social Currency:** Will sharing this make the reader look smart?
- **Practical Value:** Can the reader DO something with this today?
- **Emotion:** What's the dominant high-arousal emotion? (awe, excitement, amusement, anger)
- **Unexpected:** Does this break an assumption?
- **Concrete:** Can the reader picture it?

They need at least 3 strong ones. If the idea scores weak, help them find a stronger angle (not a different topic).

### 5. Empathy Check

Final gut check: "If a complete stranger wrote this exact post, would you stop scrolling for it?"

If no, the idea needs reframing. If yes, they're ready.

## Step Completion Checklist

ALL must be true before completing this step:

- [ ] ONE core idea stated in one sentence
- [ ] Reader-first angle (not writer-first)
- [ ] At least one concrete proof point (story, stat, or example)
- [ ] Post format chosen (one of the 15 formats)
- [ ] Target person identified (name + situation)
- [ ] Passes at least 3 of the STEPPS/SUCCESs principles
- [ ] Empathy check passed

### Trigger Logic

```
AFTER EVERY USER RESPONSE:
  1. Mentally check: how many checklist items are now satisfied?
  2. IF all 7 items satisfied → COMPLETE THE STEP NOW
  3. IF exchange count >= 9 AND at least 5 items satisfied → SOFT CHECKPOINT
  4. IF exchange count >= 12 → HARD EXIT regardless of checklist status
  5. OTHERWISE → ask ONE question targeting the most important missing item
```

---

## Step Completion

When the checklist is satisfied, present:

"**Here's your post foundation:**

**Core idea:** [one sentence]
**Reader angle:** [why they should care]
**Proof point:** [story/stat/example]
**Format:** [chosen format]
**Writing for:** [name + situation]
**Emotional charge:** [dominant emotion]
**STEPPS/SUCCESs score:** [which principles it hits]
