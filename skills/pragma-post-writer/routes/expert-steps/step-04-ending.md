# Step 4: 🎯 Ending & CTA

## STEP GOAL

Write a **strong ending** that makes the reader wish they could keep reading, and a **clear CTA** that tells them what to do next. The ending is the second most important part after the hook.

## INTERACTION MODE: Interactive

Ask ONE question at a time. Follow depth-aware progression.

## STEP-SPECIFIC RULES

- Do NOT modify the hook or body (they're locked)
- Your job is ONLY the closing section (kicker + CTA)
- The ending should connect back to the opening goal from Step 1

---

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Present the 3 Kicker Types

Explain with examples relevant to their post:

| Kicker Type | How It Works | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Recast the takeaway** | Restate your core point in a way that lands harder. Not repetition, but elevation. | How-to, data, explainer posts |
| **Tonal surprise** | Flip the tone. If formal, go relaxed. If relaxed, add weight. | Story, first-person, contrarian posts |
| **Let someone else close** | End with a direct quote from someone in your post. | Case studies, Q&A, expert roundup |

Based on their post format and tone, **recommend 1 kicker type** with a one-sentence explanation of why it fits.

Ask: **"Which kicker type feels right? Or should I pick the best fit?"**

### 2. Draft Kicker Options

Write **2 kicker variations** using their chosen type. Each should be 1-3 sentences max.

For each, briefly note:
- Why it works
- How it connects to the opening

Ask: **"Which ending resonates? Or want me to adjust?"**

### 3. Write the CTA

The CTA should connect to the original **Goal** from Step 1 (what the user wanted the reader to feel or do after reading).

Present 2-3 CTA options:
- **Action-based:** "Try this in your next meeting and tell me what happens."
- **Engagement-based:** "What's the biggest [topic] mistake you've seen? Drop it below."
- **Share-based:** "Know someone who needs to hear this? Send it their way."

Ask: **"Which CTA connects best to your goal?"**

### 4. Validate the Ending

Quick checks:
- If someone only read the last 2 sentences, would they still get the core message?
- Does the ending trail off or land with impact?
- Is the CTA clear and specific (not just "thoughts?")?

---

## What NOT to Do

- End by simply trailing off
- Use "So what do you think?" as the entire closing
- Add a CTA that has nothing to do with the post content
- Write a kicker longer than the body

---

## Step Completion Checklist

ALL must be true:

- [ ] Kicker type chosen (one of the 3 types)
- [ ] Kicker connects back to the core idea
- [ ] CTA is clear and specific
- [ ] CTA connects to the original goal from Step 1
- [ ] User confirmed the ending

### Trigger Logic

```
AFTER EVERY USER RESPONSE:
  1. IF all 5 items satisfied → COMPLETE THE STEP NOW
  2. IF exchange count >= 9 → SOFT CHECKPOINT
  3. IF exchange count >= 12 → HARD EXIT
  4. OTHERWISE → continue refining
```
