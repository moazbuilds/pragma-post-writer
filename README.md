<p align="center"><strong>Pragma is a modular AI skill and workflow that turns raw notes into publish-ready posts for social media, blogs, and forums ✍️</strong></p>

## Why Pragma?

Most one-step writers generate a draft in a single pass.
Pragma is different because it gives you two paths:

- **Flash (Quick):** one-step output when speed is the priority.
- **Ink (Expert):** a guided 5-step workflow (idea, hook, body, ending, polish) for higher-quality writing.

That means you can choose speed when needed, or use structure when quality matters.
