<p align="center"><strong>Pragma is a modular AI skill and workflow that turns raw notes into publish-ready posts for social media, blogs, and forums ✍️</strong></p>

## Why Pragma?

Most post writers behave like rephrasers.  
They take your draft, smooth the wording, and give it back. It may read better, but it often misses your true intent, your real voice, and the influence structure behind strong writing.

Pragma is built differently.

It does not begin with sentence polishing. It begins with clarity: what you actually want to say, who it is for, why it matters, and what proof supports it. Then it builds the post step by step, so the thinking gets stronger before the wording gets prettier.

So Pragma is not just a tool that writes for you.  
It is a workflow that helps you think, structure, and communicate like yourself with strategic depth.
