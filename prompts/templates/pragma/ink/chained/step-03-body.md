# Step 3: 📝 Body Writing

## STEP GOAL

Write the **body of the LinkedIn post** using the format chosen in Step 1, the hook from Step 2, and the proof points gathered earlier. The body should be concrete, vivid, and maintain the emotional charge.

## INTERACTION MODE: Interactive

Ask ONE question at a time. Follow depth-aware progression.

## STEP-SPECIFIC RULES

- Do NOT rewrite the hook (it's locked from Step 2)
- Do NOT write the ending or CTA
- Your job is ONLY the body section (between hook and ending)
- Let the Ugly First Draft be ugly. Polish comes in Step 5
- This is the "show, don't tell" step

---

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Recap the Foundation

Briefly remind the user what they're working with:
- **Core idea:** [from Step 1]
- **Format:** [chosen format]
- **Hook:** [from Step 2]
- **Proof point:** [story/stat/example from Step 1]

Ask: **"Before I draft the body, is there anything else you want to include? A specific story detail, a number, a quote?"**

### 2. Write the Ugly First Draft

Based on everything gathered, write the body section following the chosen format. Apply these rules:

**Show, Don't Tell:**
- Use the "What hell / what heaven" technique: name the specific pain they escape and relief they arrive at
- Give things the dignity of their names: write "geranium" not "flower"
- Use sensory details, specific numbers, real scenarios

**Front-Load Sentences:**
- Most important words at the beginning of each sentence
- No filler openers ("According to...", "It is important to note...", "In my opinion...")

**Keep It Concrete:**
- Could the reader draw a picture of what you described?
- Specific numbers instead of "a lot"
- Real scenarios instead of "various situations"
- Named people instead of "stakeholders"

**Format for Readability:**
- Max 3 sentences per paragraph (1 sentence paragraphs are powerful on LinkedIn)
- Max 25 words per sentence
- Simple words (use "start" not "commence", "help" not "facilitate")
- Bold key phrases
- White space between sections

Present the draft and say: "This is the **ugly first draft**. It's meant to be rough. We'll polish it in the editing step. For now, let's make sure the **content and structure** are right."

### 3. Get Feedback on Content

Ask: **"Does this capture what you wanted to say? What would you add, remove, or change?"**

Work through their feedback. Focus on:
- Is the core message coming through?
- Is the proof point landing?
- Does the emotional charge build through the body?
- Is anything confusing or out of order?

### 4. Validate the Body

Run a quick check:
- **Concrete:** Can a reader picture the scenarios described?
- **Emotional build:** Does the emotion maintain or escalate from the hook?
- **Format adherence:** Does the body follow the chosen format structure?
- **Reader value:** Is there practical value or insight the reader gets?

## Step Completion Checklist

ALL must be true:

- [ ] Body follows the chosen format structure
- [ ] Show-don't-tell applied (concrete, specific language)
- [ ] Sentences front-loaded (no filler openers)
- [ ] Emotional charge maintained from hook
- [ ] User confirmed the body content
- [ ] Readable: short paragraphs, simple words, white space

### Trigger Logic

```
AFTER EVERY USER RESPONSE:
  1. IF all 6 items satisfied → COMPLETE THE STEP NOW
  2. IF exchange count >= 9 → SOFT CHECKPOINT
  3. IF exchange count >= 12 → HARD EXIT
  4. OTHERWISE → continue refining
```
