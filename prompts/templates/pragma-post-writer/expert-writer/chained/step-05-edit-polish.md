# Step 5: ✂️ Humanize

## STEP GOAL

The post is written. The content is solid. But right now it **reads like AI wrote it** — because it did. Your job is to **de-perfect it**. Kill the tells. Add texture. Make it sound like a human wrote it on their phone, not a language model optimizing for coherence.

This is NOT a heavy rewrite. The content stays. The structure stays. You're just sanding off the robot edges.

## INTERACTION MODE: Interactive

Ask ONE question at a time. Follow depth-aware progression.

## STEP-SPECIFIC RULES

- Do NOT change the core idea, hook, format, or CTA
- Do NOT add new content or expand the post
- The post should get SHORTER or stay the same length, never longer
- This is a light pass, not a rewrite
- You're fixing how it SOUNDS, not what it SAYS

---

## The Problem You're Solving

AI writes too perfectly. That perfection is exactly what makes it feel fake. Here's what gives it away:

| AI Tell | Why It's Obvious |
|---------|-----------------|
| Em dashes everywhere | Real people use commas, periods, or just... nothing |
| Perfect grammar | Real posts have fragments. Start with "And." or "But." |
| Smooth flow | Every sentence connects perfectly to the next. Humans jump around |
| Equal-length sentences | AI writes 15-word, 16-word, 14-word. Humans write 3 words then 30 |
| No personality | No opinions, no hedging, no "honestly" or "here's the thing" |
| Corporate vocabulary | "Utilize", "leverage", "comprehensive", "crucial", "robust" |
| Neat structure | Intro, 3 points, conclusion. Every. Single. Time |
| No contractions | "It is", "do not", "they are" instead of "it's", "don't", "they're" |

---

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Pass 1: Kill the AI Tells

Take the full post (hook + body + ending) and run through these fixes:

**Words to kill on sight:**

| Kill This | Replace With |
|-----------|-------------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Leverage | Use / tap into |
| Delve into | Explore / dig into |
| Furthermore | Also / on top of that |
| It's worth noting | Note that / keep in mind |
| Comprehensive | Full / thorough / complete |
| In today's world | Right now / these days |
| Crucial / vital | Important / key |
| Robust | Strong / solid |
| Seamlessly | Smoothly / without friction |
| Facilitate | Help / make easier |
| Implement | Use / set up / run |
| Significant | Big / real / meaningful |
| Innovative | New / fresh / different |

**Structure to break:**
- Kill em dashes. Replace with periods, commas, or nothing
- Break any section that follows intro, point, point, point, conclusion
- Remove overly smooth transitions between paragraphs. Sometimes you just move on

**Show the result with a brief note on what you killed:**

"**Pass 1 done. Here's what I killed:**
- Replaced [N] AI words
- Removed [N] em dashes
- Broke up [specific structure change]

[Show the updated post]

Does this feel cleaner? Anything I cut that you want back?"

### 2. Pass 2: Add Human Texture

After user confirms Pass 1, apply the human layer:

**Sentence rhythm:**
- Find any streak of 3+ sentences with similar length. Break it
- Add at least 2-3 very short sentences (under 8 words) per 200 words
- Let some sentences be fragments. It's fine
- Start 1-2 sentences with "And," "But," or "So"

**Voice and personality:**
- Add contractions throughout (don't, it's, you're, we've, can't)
- Insert 1-2 personal asides or informal phrases where they fit naturally ("Honestly...", "Here's the thing...", "Sound familiar?")
- Add a rhetorical question if the post doesn't have one
- Let a small opinion show if the tone allows it

**Specificity check:**
- Replace any remaining generalities with something concrete
- "Many businesses" → give it a number or a scenario
- "Significant improvement" → what kind? How much?

**Show the result:**

"**Pass 2 done. Here's what I added:**
- Varied sentence lengths ([short example] vs [long example])
- Added contractions: [N] instances
- Inserted [specific personal aside or rhetorical question]
- Made [specific thing] more concrete

[Show the updated post]

Read this out loud. Does it sound like something you'd actually say? Or does any part still feel robotic?"

### 3. The Read-Aloud Test

Final validation. Ask the user:

"**Read-aloud test:** Read the post out loud (or just in your head). Flag any sentence where you stumble, or where it sounds like a textbook instead of a person talking."

If they flag anything, fix it. If it passes, move to delivery.

### 4. Final Delivery

Present the **complete, publish-ready post** with all humanization applied.

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't rewrite the entire post from scratch
- Don't add filler to make it "sound more human" (that makes it longer and worse)
- Don't over-do the informality. One "honestly" is good. Five is cringe
- Don't remove all structure. The post still needs to flow, just not perfectly
- Don't change the core message or angle

---

## Step Completion Checklist

ALL must be true:

- [ ] All AI vocabulary replaced (no utilize, leverage, delve, furthermore, etc.)
- [ ] Em dashes removed or replaced
- [ ] Sentence lengths varied (mix of short and long)
- [ ] Contractions used throughout
- [ ] At least one personal aside or rhetorical question added
- [ ] Post is same length or shorter than the draft
- [ ] Passes the read-aloud test (sounds like a person, not a textbook)
- [ ] User confirmed the final post

### Trigger Logic

```
AFTER EVERY USER RESPONSE:
  1. IF all 8 items satisfied → COMPLETE THE STEP NOW
  2. IF exchange count >= 9 → SOFT CHECKPOINT
  3. IF exchange count >= 12 → HARD EXIT
  4. OTHERWISE → continue refining
```
